# Megatron-LLM

This library enables pre-training and fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) at scale.
Our repository is a modification of the [original Megatron-LM codebase](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) by Nvidia.

Added key features include:
- [LLaMa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971), [LLaMa 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288), [Falcon](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae), and [Code Llama](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12950) support
- Support training of large models (70B Llama 2, 65B Llama 1 and 40B Falcon) on commodity hardware on multiple nodes.
- 3-way parallelism: tensor parallel, pipeline parallel and data parallel training (inherited from Megatron)
- grouped-query attention (GQA) and multi-query attention (MQA)
- Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) [was added independently by the Megatron project subsequent to us]
- RMS layer norm
- FlashAttention 2
- BF16 / FP16 training
- Support for special tokens & tokenizers
- WandB integration
- ROtary Position Embedding ([ROPE](https://together.ai/blog/llama-2-7b-32k)) scaling for extra large context windows
- Support for publishing your checkpoints to the huggingface hub.
- Instruction finetuning support
- Metrics support: Ease to add custom metrics to evaluate on the validation set while training
