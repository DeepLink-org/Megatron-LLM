# Megatron-LLM

This library enables pre-training and fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) at scale.
Our repository is a modification of the [original Megatron-LM codebase](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) by Nvidia.

Added key features include:
- [Llama](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971), [Llama 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288) and [Falcon](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae) support
- support training of large models (70B Llama2, 65B Llama1 and 40B Falcon) on commodity hardware on multiple nodes
- 3-way parallelism: tensor parallel, pipeline parallel and data parallel training (inherited from Megatron)
- grouped-query attention (GQA) and multi-query attention (MQA)
- Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) [was added independently by the Megatron project subsequent to us]
- RMS layer norm
- FlashAttention 2
- BF16 / FP16 training
- Support for special tokens & tokenizers
- WandB integration

# Setup

Because of heavy use of [Apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex), this codebase is currently for Nvidia GPUs only.

Like [Megatron](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM), we recommend [the NGC container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch). Instructions for obtaining and running this is at the link above.

A C++ compiler and the ninja build system may also be necessary.

We additionally add a dependency on [HuggingFace Transfomers](https://pypi.org/project/transformers/). `einops` is also required. 

PyTorch>=2.0.0 is required for flash attention.

A recommended entrypoint is `examples/finetune.sh`.
Information on preparing data is at `tokenize-utils/README.md`.
